    D --> E[Return JWT Token to Frontend]
    E --> F[User is Authenticated]
    
    G[User uploads stock CSV / enters data] --> B
    B --> H[API Call to PortfolioController]
    H --> I[Spring Boot processes & saves to MySQL]
    
    J[User sets alert] --> B

#USER JOURNEY FLOWCHART
User (Frontend)
    ↓
[1] User takes an action
    └── e.g., logs in, uploads portfolio, sets alert

Frontend (React App)
    ↓
[2] Sends a request to backend (Spring Boot)
    └── HTTP API Request (e.g., POST /auth/login)

Backend (Spring Boot)
    ↓
[3] Request received by specific Controller
    ├── AuthController for login/signup
    ├── PortfolioController for stock data
    └── AlertController for stock alerts

Controller
    ↓
[4] Validates input data (e.g., is email correct?)
    └── Uses DTOs & annotations like @Valid

Service Layer
    ↓
[5] Business logic happens here
    ├── Auth: check credentials & issue JWT token
    ├── Portfolio: save stock, calculate gains/losses
    └── Alert: save price alert for monitoring

Repository (JPA)
    ↓
[6] Interacts with the database (MySQL)
    └── Save/retrieve/update user, portfolio, alerts

Database (MySQL)
    ↓
[7] Stores user data securely
    └── Tables: users, holdings, alerts

Service Layer
    ↓
[8] Sends the result (data, success/failure) back

Controller
    ↓
[9] Builds API response (JSON) for frontend

Frontend (React)
    ↓
[10] Updates UI based on the response
    ├── Show success/failure messages
    └── Display updated portfolio/alerts
